## Predicting Loan Payback | Vault
🧠 2025 Kaggle Playground Series – Loan Payback Prediction

## Overview

This dataset comes from the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series, a monthly challenge designed for practicing machine learning on approachable, synthetic tabular data.
The task is to predict the probability that a borrower will pay back their loan.


## Objective
Build models to estimate the likelihood of loan repayment for each borrower in the test set.
Submissions are scored using Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC ROC).

## Dataset Format
Target Variable: loan_paid_back (probability of repayment)

Submission Format:
  id,loan_paid_back
  593994,0.5
  593995,0.2
  593996,0.1
Evaluation Metric: ROC-AUC

## Timeline
Start: November 1, 2025
End: November 30, 2025 (11:59 PM UTC)
Notes
The dataset is synthetically generated to mimic real-world loan behavior.
Designed for lightweight experimentation with feature engineering and model blending.
The best submissions from this competition will be used for blending and ensemble experiments.
